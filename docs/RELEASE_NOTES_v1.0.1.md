# Release Notes - v1.0.1

**Release Date:** 2026-01-25
**Type:** Patch release (bug fix)

---

## Summary

This patch release fixes a bug where shell completions could not be sourced due to log messages being mixed into the output.

---

## Bug Fixes

### Shell completions broken by log output (#25)

**Problem:** Running `source <(mvm completions bash)` failed with a syntax error because the startup log message was output to stdout along with the completion script:

```
[INFO] Starting Midnight Validator Monitor v1.0.0 (schema v1)
_mvm() {
    ...
```

Bash interpreted the log line as code, causing:
```
syntax error near unexpected token `('
```

**Fix:** Logging is now skipped for the `completions` command, same as for the TUI `view` command.

**Affected users:** Anyone trying to install shell completions via the documented method.
