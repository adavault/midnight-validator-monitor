# Release Notes - v1.0.3

**Type:** Patch release (UX improvement)

---

## Summary

This patch release fixes a usability issue where `mvm install` would stop running services but not restart them after an upgrade.

---

## Fixes

### Auto-restart services after upgrade (#34)

**Problem:** When running `mvm install` to upgrade an existing installation, the command would stop the mvm-sync service before replacing the binary but did not restart it afterward. This required manual intervention (`sudo systemctl start mvm-sync`) after every upgrade.

**Fix:** The install command now:
- Tracks which services were running before the upgrade
- Automatically restarts those services after installation completes
- Shows an appropriate completion message based on whether this is an upgrade or fresh install

**Upgrade behavior (service was running):**
```
==> Stopping existing mvm-sync service
==> Installing binary
    ...
==> Restarting mvm-sync service
    mvm-sync started successfully

Services restarted:
  - mvm-sync (was running, now restarted)
```

**Fresh install behavior (no services running):**
```
Installation Complete!

Next steps:
  1. Start the sync daemon:
       sudo systemctl start mvm-sync
  ...
```
