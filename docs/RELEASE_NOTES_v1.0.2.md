## Fixes

### Release binaries now work on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (#33)

**Problem:** v1.0.1 release binaries were built on Ubuntu 24.04 (GLIBC 2.39), causing them to fail on Ubuntu 22.04 and other older systems:

```
./mvm: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.39' not found
```

**Fix:** Release binaries are now built on Ubuntu 22.04 (GLIBC 2.35), ensuring compatibility with:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended)
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Debian 12+
- Other distributions with GLIBC 2.35+
