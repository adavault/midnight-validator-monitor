## MVM v0.9.3 Released

**Midnight Validator Monitor v0.9.3** is now available with improved sparkline accuracy.

### What's New

**Sparkline Epoch Alignment Fix**
- The "Last 48h" sparkline now uses **epoch-based** counting instead of timestamp-based
- Ensures blocks and seats are counted over the exact same time periods
- Label updated to "24 Epochs" for clarity
