## MVM v0.9.3 Released

**Sparkline accuracy fix** - blocks and seats now counted over identical epoch boundaries.

### Changes
- Sparkline uses epoch-based counting (was timestamp-based)
- Label: "Last 48h" → "24 Epochs"

### Install
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/adavault/midnight-validator-monitor/releases/download/v0.9.3/mvm-v0.9.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
